# Representative Proportion Voting

As detailed in [my blog post](https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/representative-proportional-voting/),
representative proportion voting is a electoral system I invented for Canada that maintains the local representation that FPTP
offers for independent runners, while assigning seats to parties in a proportional manner. This code was developed
in order to demonstrate how our house of commons would look like.

The analysis this code aided created be seen [here](https://blog.elijahlopez.ca/posts/representative-proportional-voting/#2021-general-elections-fptp-versus-rpv).

To reproduce my results, simply install the packages in `requirements.txt` via `pip install -r requirements.txt` and
run `python rpv.py` in your terminal. If you are not on Windows, you may need to use `pip3` and `python3`.
